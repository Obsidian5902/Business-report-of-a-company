Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard integrating data from multiple Google Sheets, including Supplier, Customer, Product, Order, and Order Item tables. Built a robust data model using star schema principles, creating relationships between dimension tables and the fact table (Order Item). Designed measures with DAX to calculate key metrics such as Total Sales, Number of Orders, and Customer Count. Visualized business insights through dynamic charts, tables, and slicers, enabling end-users to analyze sales trends by product, supplier performance, and customer distribution. Automated data refresh from Google Sheets to keep the dashboard updated with the latest data.
